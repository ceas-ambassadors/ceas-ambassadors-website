# CEAS Ambassadors Website
This repository is home to a possible rewrite of [the old ambassador's website](https://github.com/kurtlewis/OrganizationManager).

The primary purpose of this rewrite is to increase ease of maintainence, allow for new functionality, and to fix some of the pain points of the old website, both from a development and user standpoint.

This repository is open source for the purposes of showing progress on architecture design documentation - but as of now there is no guarantee this project will progress past that point.
