[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ceas-ambassadors/ceas-ambassadors-website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ceas-ambassadors/ceas-ambassadors-website)

This repository is home to a rewrite of [the old ambassador's website](https://github.com/kurtlewis/OrganizationManager).

The primary purpose of this rewrite is to increase ease of maintainence, allow for new functionality, and to fix some of the pain points of the old website, both from a development and user standpoint. You can find the site [here](https://ucceasambassadors.com/).

Comprehensive docs can be found in the `docs` folder. 
* Instructions for getting started can be found in `docs/dev-guide.md` [here](docs/dev-guide.md).
* Information about the server and how to manage production can be found in `docs/production.md` [here](docs/production.md).
* The schema for the database and how to connect using MySQL can be found in `docs/database.md` [here](docs/database.md).
* The `tech-design.md` is deprecated documentation.

## Functionality
This website is used to faciliate operations for a student tour group for the University of Cincinnati College of Engineering and Applied Science. It is home to tour listings, member management, and profiles on existing members. Members can sign up for tours they'd like to give, view their progress towards membership requirements, and update details on their involvement.
