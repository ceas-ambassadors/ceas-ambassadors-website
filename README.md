This repository is home to a rewrite of [the old ambassador's website](https://github.com/kurtlewis/OrganizationManager).

The primary purpose of this rewrite is to increase ease of maintainence, allow for new functionality, and to fix some of the pain points of the old website, both from a development and user standpoint.

Comprehensive docs can be found in the `docs` folder. Instructions for getting can be found in `docs/dev-guide.md`.
